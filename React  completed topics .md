### REACT JS basics
  - React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.
  - It was developed by Facebook and is now maintained by a community of developers.
  - React uses a component-based architecture, where UI elements are broken down into reusable and modular pieces.

### COMPONENT CONCEPT
- Components are independent and reusable bits of code.
- They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML
- Components come in two types, Class components and Function components

### Tools you need to install
- NODE JS
- Visual Studio Code 

### CREATE & RUN REACT APP USING VITE
- ViteJS is a modern build tool and development server that aims to optimize the front-end development experience.
```sh
npm create vite@latest
```
- ASSET BUNDLING

### WHY VITE

- Faster build times: Vitejs uses esbuild, which is a blazing fast compiler that can build projects in a fraction of the time that it takes other build tools.
- Hot reload: Vitejs has hot reload, which means that your code will be updated in real time as you make changes, so you can see the results of your changes immediately
- Small bundle size: Vitejs bundles are typically much smaller than bundles created by other build tools, which can improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage.
  
### ESSENTIAL Vite Commands
### REACT PROJECT
- Distribution
- Node Modules
- Public
- Source
- Package.json
- Vite Config
- Structure

### MY FIRST FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT

In React, a functional component is a type of component that is defined using a JavaScript function.

- They are easier to read and write.
- They are simpler and lighter, making them faster to render.
- They do not require the use of the "this" keyword, making them less error-prone.
- They can take advantage of React's Hooks, which allow you to use state and other features without using class components.

### JSX JAVASCRIPT XML
- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript code
- It is commonly used in React applications to define the structure and content of UI components.
- JSX is not a separate language, but a preprocessor that converts the HTML-like code into plain JavaScript.
- It enables you to use JavaScript expressions within your HTML-like code, making it easier to dynamically generate content.
- JSX can improve code readability and maintainability by allowing developers to write declarative, intuitive code.

### JSX CONVENTIONS
- You need to return a single parent element in JSX
- You can implement JS directly in JSX
- All Tags Self-close in JSX
- ClassName and HTMLFor, not class and for in JSX
- Write all HTML Attributes in camelCase in JSX
- Write Inline Styles as Objects in JSX

### JSX Inline if else
### Immediately invoked 
- Function expressions inside your JSX
